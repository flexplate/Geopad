# Geopad

(Very) Quick & dirty Winforms editor to make it easy to create GeoJSON files to test GeoJsonRenderer.

Draw on the screen, save to a new file.

Does not support opening existing files, extended properties, basic properties, or anything outside of creating basic Point, LineString or Polygon geometries and saving them to a file. Frankly, it doesn't even do that very well.
